** trace

: Execute the program with probes enabled as specified
: 
:   probes.exe trace 
: 
: Guarantees that all specified probes are enabled before the program starts.
: Start execution of the program in a separate child process with 
: probes enabled as specified. 
: Then, detach from the child process and return, while the child process continues program execution normally.
: User can call 'attach' on the running process to enable/disable probes again. 
: The need for 'trace' command arises when tracing probes right at the program start.
: Note that if the program invokes `exec` on the same binary,
: the resulting process will not have any probes enabled.
: All threads created by the program will have the same probes enabled.
